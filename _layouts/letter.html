        <h3 style="height:28.8px;" class="section-title">Re:Data Analyst at Optiver</h3>
        <p>Dear Optiver hiring manager. </p>
<<p>I am excited to be applying for the open Data Analyst role at Optiver, as my professional qualifications are closely aligned with it: 3+ years of experience dealing with large amount of data, translating meaningless data into a valuable information. </p>
<p>I have to say as a data lover, would be so much fun and delightful work with all kind of data provide by Optive. Market may change fast, but being faster analysing data would be an extraordinary experience.  Once Optive core values harmonize with my, make me feel confident to make this job application, mainly “true to ourselves and open to each other”. Working along professionals from over 40 countries would be amazing! </p>
<p>Currently I am a Business Intelligence Analyst at CIALNE, a company that works with poultry farming and livestock, with about 4.000 employees. As a BI analyst, I have designed pipelines to automate process using open-source tools. I am responsible for tracking all KPI’s from the company, working closely with the strategic management unit. Using a well know data visualization tool to develop and present clear and informative reports to the management team. </p>
<p>As a Data Analyst, I would be excited to help the trading and research teams from Optive get and spread interesting insights based on the data they get. Using my knowledge to improve what they already have, and learning with them to improve me as person and professional </p>
<p>To illustrate the scope of my career history and professional competencies, please take a moment to review my enclosed resume. I would be happy to provide greater detail about my skills and experience during an interview. Please call me at your earliest convenience. </p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon. </p>



<p>Thank you for your time and attention. </p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Paulo Igor Rivero. </p>
