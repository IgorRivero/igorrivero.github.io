        <h3 style="height:28.8px;" class="section-title">Re:Data Analyst at Apple</h3>
        <p>Dear Apple hiring team. </p>
<p>I am excited to be applying for the open Data Analyst role at Apple, as my professional qualifications are closely aligned with it: 3+ years of experience dealing with large amount of data, translating meaningless data into a valuable information and making business requirements become technical solutions to support business needs. Developing this way, a data-driven culture in companies I've worked. </p>

<p>If I could use two words to define Apple, would be innovation and technology. That’s why I’m a fan (and user) of this brand. And that’s also the reason I think would be a unique and amazing experience work with all kind of data provide by Apple, using all my experience and analytics skills to improve business performance. </p>

<p>Currently I am a Business Intelligence Analyst at CIALNE, a company that works with poultry farming and livestock, with about 4.000 employees. As a BI analyst, I’m part of the IT department ensuring data integrity and availability to generate insights. I have designed pipelines to automate process using open-source tools. I am responsible for tracking all KPI’s from the company, working closely with the strategic management unit. Using a well know data visualization tool to develop and present clear and informative reports to the management team. </p> 
<p>As a Data Analyst, I would be excited to help business analytics team from Apple get and spread interesting insights based on the data they get. Using my knowledge to improve what they already have, and learning with them to improve me as person and professional. </p>
<p>To illustrate the scope of my career history and professional competencies, please take a moment to review my enclosed resume. I would be happy to provide greater detail about my skills and experience during an interview. Please call me at your earliest convenience. </p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon. </p>





<p>Thank you for your time and attention. </p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Paulo Igor Rivero. </p>
