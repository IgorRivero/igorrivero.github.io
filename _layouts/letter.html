        <h3 style="height:28.8px;" class="section-title">Re:Data Engineer at Hubs</h3>

        <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">I'm a Data engineer with over 5 years of work experience looking for an opportunity to apply my skills in new ways. I would love to join with my knowledge and enthusiasm to bring results and good moments at Hubs. I'm currently working as a consultant to a retail company as a client, responsible for creating and maintaining plenty of pipelines regarding ingestion and data quality. </p>
        <p style = "text-indent:2cm;>
I’m willing to make this big step, move to another country, live in another culture, have new experiences, learn a lot and grow as a professional and for sure as person. I’m glad I had a chance to meet some people that already work at HUBs, one of them a friend of mine that we went to college together, and another wonderful person, from another country , another culture, but that could bring bright joy in your eyes while talking about the company and life in Amsterdam, that makes me feel that I do want to work there, I do want to live there!
</p>


<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">
As a professional I do have plenty of experience with SQL, ELT , BI tools , worked as a Business Intelligent Analyst for almost 3 years. Already worked migrating a entire BI enviroment, developed dashboards to track KPI's and support others several areas of the company to make data-driven decisions. Since then I’m Data Engineer, working on pipelines to automate tasks, optimize tables and process, integrate Log analytics with third-party system to automate warning and alerts. Got great experience with python, spark and Azure tools. I do appreciate the teamwork, I’ve always been a believer that many heads think better than one.
</p>


<p style = "text-indent:2cm;"> As I do follow Hubs on other social medias, I usually picture myself in those meetings, looks so funny, and joyful. I would love to chat more about myself, and my knowledge. And of course, why I would like to move to the Netherlands to work on HUBs. </p>


<p >Looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>




<p>Thank you for your time and attention. </p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Paulo Igor Rivero. </p>
