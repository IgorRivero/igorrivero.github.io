        <h3 style="height:28.8px;" class="section-title">Re:Data Engineer at Hubs</h3>

        <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">I'm a Data engineer with over 5 years of work experience looking for an opportunity to apply my skills in new ways. I would love to join with my knowledge and enthusiasm to bring results and good moments at Hubs. I'm currently working as a consultant with a retail company as a client, responsible for creating and maintaining plenty of pipelines regarding ingestion and data quality. </p>
        <p>
I’m willing to make this big step, move to another country, live another culture, new experiences, learn a lot and grow as professional and for sure as person. I’m glad I had a chance to meet some people that already work at HUBs, one of them a friend of mine that we went to college together, and another wonderful person, from another country , another culture, but that could bring bright joy in your eyes while talking about the company and life in Amsterdam, that make me feel that I do want to work there, I do want to live there!
</p>


<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">
As a professional I do got plenty of experience with SQL, ELT , BI tools , worked as a Business Intelligent for almost 3 years and since then I’m Data Engineer, working on pipelines to automate tasks, check data quality and monitor process. Got great experience with python, spark and Azure tools. I do appreciate the teamwork, I’ve been always a believer that many heads think better than one.
</p>


<p style = "text-indent:2cm;"> As I do follow Hubs in other social medias, I usually picture myself in those meetings, look so funny, and joyful. I would love to chat a bit more about myself, and my knowledge. And of course, why I would like to move to the Netherlands working on HUBs. </p>


<p >Looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>




<p>Thank you for your time and attention. </p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Paulo Igor Rivero. </p>
